For our Final Project, we are interested in desiging/developing two already existing games; Fruit Ninja and Minesweeper. 

Starting with Fruit Ninja, we would use the mouse as the sword so that when the player presses and drags the sword it will slice the fruit and earn the player points, the player is only allowed 3 strikes until it is game over or until they hit a bomb. A strike is defined as a full fruit that hits the bottom of the screen. The fruit and bombs will be randomly generated to be thrown up in the air and fall down using gravity. Based on the fruit there will be points awarded to the player and the high score will be saved. We will implement a way for the player to pick between different game modes (easy, medium, & hard) and customize different parts of the game experience (including the use of different kinds of swords and backgrounds). Players will also receive bonus points if three of the same fruit are sliced at once. This game will satisfy all of the requirements of the projecct. Starting off with a meaningful object-oriented design which can include an abstract class representing a fruit that is extended by all fruits. For the event-driven programming including Java graphics and Java Swing GUI components requirement, we will be using Mouse Events, more specifically mousePressed, mouseDragged, and mouseReleased to simulate the sword. Graphics wise, we will be using a variety of fruit pixel art that will be animated. In regards to the threads for animation or computational speedup requirement, depending on which level is chosen, the harder and faster the fruit will fall from the screen using threads and possibly use threads to animate different kinds of swords. For each level, the speed and the amount of fruit falling at once increaes. For the appropriate use of data structures requirement, we will be using at least ArrayLists and tree structures. Finally, the last requirement is to include something we have not learned yet, and we are planning on implementing sound effects throughout the program. **May need to add how we would go about programming this?**

The second game we plan on implementing would be a clone of the classic Microsoft game Minesweeper. At the start of a game, the program would generate a random array of tiles, each designated as either a bomb or a free space. The size of the array and the amount of bombs could be specified by the player, and the game would be controlled entirely through mouse clicks. Each tile would contain hidden information about itself and the area around it, containing a number indicating the amount of bombs in the 8 surrounding tiles, a bomb, or nothing if the space is not adjacent to any bombs. The goal for the player is to click on/reveal all non-bomb tiles on the board, while not triggering any bombs themselves...........

Below is a rough schedule with some major milestones in order to complete this final project on time:

               Thursday April 16th: 4:00 - 6:00: Start Fuit Ninja. Get "fruit" (may just use balls as a place holder 
               for now) to fall properly on screen, with the three different game levels. Get sword functionality 
               working as well.
               
               Tuesday April 20th: 4:00-6:00:  Add bombs, a counter for score, and the 3 different strikes on screen.
               
               Wednesday April 15th: 3:30-5:30: Clean up anything. Hopefully by now the game should 
               have full functionality. Fix what isn't workly properly.
               
               Thursday April 16th: 4:00-6:00: Make the game look pretty. Add option for different backgrounds and 
               swords. 
               
               Tuesday April 21st: 4:00- 6:00: Add sound effects to the game. Add any enhacements we think of.
               
               Wednesday April 22nd: 3:30-5:30: Clean up the game and completely finish it. Possibly start 
               Minesweeper.
               
               Thursday April 23rd: 4:00-6:00: 
               
               Tuesday April 28th: 4:00-6:00: 
               
               Wednesday April 29th: 3:30-5:30: 
               
               Thursday April 30th: 4:00-6:00:
               
               **Sundays are also open to work on any unfinished tasks**
